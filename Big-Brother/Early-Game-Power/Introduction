The purpose of this project is to look into the statistics of the first 3 weeks of Big Brother to see whether it is better to win in the
first few weeks of the game and potentially put a target on you or lay low and let the other houseguests take shots at each other.

For this, I built out a SQL database and analyzed the data using Python in VSCode.

For transparency sake, I have to make 2 notes:
  1. I have not used any data from Big Brother's first season - this is more representative of what the UK version of Big Brother where it is
  all voted on by the public and not what it now is. So all data begins with Big Brother 2.

  2. In Big Brother 16 and 17, the majority of the season had 2 Heads of Household then their nominees would compete in a challenge to get
  off the block and 'dethrone' their HoH. So for consistency sake, I have defined the week's Head of Household as whomever was sitting at
  the HOH on eviction night for the entire dataset.
