The purpose of this project is to look into the statistics of the first 3 weeks of Big Brother to see whether it is better to win in the
first few weeks of the game and potentially put a target on you or lay low and let the other houseguests take shots at each other.

For this, I built out a SQL database and analyzed the data using Python in VSCode.
