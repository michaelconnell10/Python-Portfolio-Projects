I do have to preface this by saying that Big Brother season 25 is somewhat of an anomaly for a few reasons.
  First, 4-time Survivor player Cirie Fields was part of the season 25 cast alongside her son, Jared. As a result, a lot of the early weeks focused on them as a duo.

  Second, there was an entire week with zero gameplay. Instead, it focused on two players having a battle back to re-enter the game. This meant that these two players got a significant
  boost in confessionals - 24 each across the first two episodes. Aside from Cirie, the person with the highest amount of visibility that week had 12 total.

Introduction
Big Brother 25 was the longest season in the show's (US) history, being 1 day longer than the previous record of 99 days (18, 20, & 21).
